## Description

This app is a lightweight fitness tracker that can handle user entries and use those entries to populate a running journal of exercises completed by the user. Entries include the date an entry is created and a stats page dynamically compiles the total number of exercises and types of weight or distances completed on that day. The app runs on javascript, node, express and the database is powered by mongodb. The app is deployed on heroku.
